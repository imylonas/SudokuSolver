# SudokuSolver
Sudoku Solver Algorithm in C#.
A user will provide a file constraint the Sudoku puzzle
and as a result to receive the solution if exist and if not exist 
to get a message letting him know that it can not be solved. 
A Sudoku puzzle can be any dimension the user need but it must be a cubic grid!
My target is the solution to be extendable and to provide Unit tests.
