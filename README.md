# SudokuSolver
Sudoku Solver Algorithm in C#.<br/>
A user will provide a file constraint the Sudoku puzzle<br/>
and as a result to receive the solution if exist and if not exist<br/>
to get a message letting him know that it can not be solved.<br/> 
A Sudoku puzzle can be any dimension the user need but it must be a cubic grid!<br/>
My target is the solution to be extendable and to provide Unit tests.
